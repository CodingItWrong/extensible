* At the bottom of any page, click the Edit This Page link
* This will take you to the "source code" of the page on GitHub. From there, click the pencil icon. If you aren't logged in to GitHub, you'll be prompted to log in or create a free account.

* You'll be given a text editor with the source code of the page. It's written in a format called Markdown, which mostly reads like plain text with some special characters. To learn more, see [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
