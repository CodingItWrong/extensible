Most software draws a hard line between developers and users. Developers write code using tooling like editors or IDEs, then package that software for use by compiling it or uploading it to a server. As a user, you get the functionality the developer has provided, but if your needs are different than the developer assumed, you're out of luckâ€”you get the software the developer has given you.

If that software is commercial software, you can ask the developer to fix a bug or add a feature, but they may say no, or it may not be high on their priority list.

If that software is open-source software, you have the option of downloading the source code and making a change yourself. But there are still a lot of barriers to making the change: you need to have experience as a software developer in general and with the programming languages the software is written in in particular, you need to have the software development tooling set up locally, the developer need to have included complete and up-to-date setup instructions, and there need to be no environmental differences between your setup and the developer's that prevent you from getting the code to run. These barriers are so big that very few users of an open source software package will ever make a change to it.

With these barriers to making changes to software, it seems like any time existing software doesn't meet our needs, we don't have any good options for improving it.

But there's another way to write software that tears down the barrier between user and developer, empowering anyone to make improvements to it. I'm calling this approach Extensible Software.

Some of the attributes of Extensible Software include:

* No extra tooling needed to make changes. If you can run the software as a user, you already have everything you need to modify it.
* Rapid feedback. You can make a change to the software and quickly see the results of the change. This enables experimentation.
* Gradual learning curve. You don't need to learn everything about the software to be able to make small changes to it. You can be productive right away making small changes, and learn more as you need it.

Extensible Software empowers users because it allows them to get big results with little effort. The purpose of this web site is to promote Extensible Software by describing and assessing past and present software that has some significant degree of extensibility.

I hope you learn from this site, and I hope you extend it too! You can make corrections or additions to any page by clicking "Edit this page", or learn more at [Extending](./extending).
